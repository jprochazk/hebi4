# the compiler can do some basic arity checking
# in case the callee is a function declaration,
# and it's clear syntactically:

fn f(a, b, c) { }

# we could choose to just emit a `dyn` call and
# let this explode at runtime, and this is somewhat
# unusual for a mostly runtime-checked language,
# but it's useful so this will error at compile time:

f(0)
